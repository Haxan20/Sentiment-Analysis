# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis: classifying customers review as  positive, negative or Neutral
# Educational NLP Analysis Project

A demonstration project for performing two fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks on text data: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Classification.

## Overview

This project leverages powerful **pre-trained models** from the `transformers` library to quickly analyze text. The goal is to provide a clear, simple example of how to integrate these models into a Python workflow.

-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies the emotional tone of text (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).
-   **Topic Classification:** Categorizes text into predefined thematic topics.

## Important Note

This project is intended **strictly for educational purposes**. It serves as a learning tool for understanding NLP concepts, model APIs, and Python scripting. It is not designed for high-throughput, real-world, or production-level analysis.
